## Part 1
This is the microwave we have in my house:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="Microwave-full.jpg" width=500 >
<img src="Microwave-open.jpg" width=500>
</div>

And here you can see it in use:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

And this is the interface up close:

</div>

This microwave is very convienent for standard everyday uses. It is intuitive to press the numbers and then press start and have the microwave work for the designated time, however, there are some apparent design flaws.

First, the button  to the right of 0, what does it mean to have a timer / clock button? This button is not easily discovered without experimentation, in fact, I had to return to the kitchen to really remember what it did. Pressing this button once will allow you to set the time to whatever time by pressing the numbers, but pressing the button again brings up EE. I have no idea what EE means and pressing any other button on the microwave has no effect when the microwave is in this state. To exit this state you must press the Stop / Clear button.
