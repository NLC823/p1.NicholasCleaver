## Part 1
This is the microwave we have in my house:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="Microwave-full.jpg" width=500 >
<img src="Microwave-open.jpg" width=500>
</div>

And here you can see it in use:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="Microwave-in-use.gif" width=650>
</div>

And this is the interface up close:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

This microwave is very convienent for standard everyday uses. It is intuitive to press the numbers and then press start and have the microwave work for the designated time.
