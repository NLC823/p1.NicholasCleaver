## Part 1
This is the microwave we have in my house:

<div style="text-align: center">

<img src="Microwave-open.jpg" width=500>
</div>

And here you can see it in use:

</div>

And this is the interface up close:

</div>

This microwave is very convienent for standard everyday uses. It is intuitive to press the numbers and then press start and have the microwave work for the designated time, however, there are some apparent design flaws.

First, the button  to the right of 0, what does it mean to have a **Timer / Clock** button? The Stop / Clear button uses the same notation, but those two tasks are relatable in a way that Timer and Clock are not This button is not easily discovered without experimentation, in fact, I had to return to the kitchen to really remember what it did. Pressing this button once will allow you to set the time to whatever time by pressing the numbers, but pressing the button again brings up EE. I have no idea what EE means and pressing any other button on the microwave has no effect when the microwave is in this state. To exit this state you must press the Stop / Clear button. See below for this interaction:

</div>

Second there are several buttons on the microwave in which it is not clear what they do to the microwave. These buttons appear at the bottom of the interface and include Cook, Defrost, Reheat, Melt and Soften. Are these buttons quick ways to start timers of specific lengths? Do these buttons change the power level of the microwave? Do these buttons automatically start or do you need to press start after pressing one of these buttons? The choice of words used for these buttons has meaning in English so maybe if we want to soften butter we can just throw it in the microwave and press soften. It might work, but
