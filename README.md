## Part 1
This is the microwave we have in my house:

<div style="text-align: center">

<img src="Microwave-open.jpg" width=500>
</div>

And here you can see it in use:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

And this is the interface up close:

</div>

This microwave is very convenient for standard everyday uses. It is intuitive to press the numbers and then press start and have the microwave work for the designated time, however, there are some apparent design flaws.

First, the button to the right of **0**, what does it mean to have a **Timer / Clock** button? The **Stop / Clear** button uses the same notation, but those two tasks are relatable in a way that timer and clock are not. This button is not easily understood without experimentation, in fact, I had to return to the kitchen to really remember what it did while writing this page. Pressing this button once will allow you to set the time to whatever time by pressing the numbers, you can confirm the change by pressing start, but if you press the **Timer / Clock** button again, the microwave brings up EE. I have no idea what EE means and pressing any other button when the microwave is in this state has no effect. To exit this state you must press the **Stop / Clear** button. See below for this interaction:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Second there are several buttons on the microwave in which it is not clear what they do to the microwave. These buttons appear at the bottom of the interface and include **Cook**, **Defrost**, **Reheat**, **Melt** and **Soften**. Are these buttons quick ways to start timers of specific lengths? Do these buttons change the power level of the microwave? Do these buttons automatically start or do you need to press start after pressing one of these buttons? I have had this microwave for years and I do not think I can answer a single one of these questions for any of these buttons. The choice of words used, however, has meaning in English so maybe if we want to soften some butter, we can just throw it in the microwave and press **Soften**. It might work, but it is still unclear what the microwave does to achieve this.
